The spatial tuning of neuronal populations in the visual cortical regions is linked to the spatial frequency (SF) selectivity of neurons. Due to this link, we hypothesized that prolonged exposure (e.g., adaptation) to high/low SF would decrease the sensitivity of a group of neurons with respectively small/large receptive field (RF) sizes, which would result in a change in population receptive field (pRF) sizes. To test this hypothesis, we first psychophysically tested the perceptual aftereffect after SF adaptation; then, we integrated the SF adaptation paradigm into the standard pRF mapping procedure to investigate the spatial tuning of the early visual cortex after adaptation to relatively high or low SF. Results showed that adaptation to a low/high SF resulted in a decrease/an increase in pRF sizes, respectively. Our results provide evidence that the SF tuning of the visual cortex is related to the selective spatial frequency selection of visual neural populations, which might have implications on visual acuity and size perception.
